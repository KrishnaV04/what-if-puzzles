What If? PUZZLES!
For Digital CodeDay Spring 2021!
Using code and 5 sensors both input and output, below is a 3x3 puzzle game.
Sensors are - rotary potentiometer, buzzer, led, OLED display 0.96'', and a button.
All sensors are from the Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino.

Playing the game:
1. Game's main page includes a puzzle and a number box. The number represents the choice on rotary potentiometer.
2. Toggle the potentiometer to switch numbers from 0-9
3. The grid is as follows: 
  0 1 2
  3 4 5
  6 7 8 9
4. As seen on the grid there are 10 different numbers that can be displayed from the roatary potentiometer.
5. By using the button you slide a the number tile to the X tile slot.
6. The game is to slide until you get a image, and the default image is a diamond.

Modifications:
TO modify the game with your own images or code you require a image to cpp program.

Above ^ is the one I used and it was really heplful and ez to use.

Use the various mini.ino files to help run individual code instead of the whole program.
HAVE FUN!
